# Advanced Data Analytics in R

This repository contains a collection of R scripts demonstrating advanced statistical analysis techniques with practical examples. The work includes simulation studies, resampling methods, and regression modeling commonly applied in data science and research analytics.

## üìä Topics Covered

‚úÖ **Weighted Least Squares (WLS)**  
- Estimation using different weight matrices  
- Significance testing of predictors  

‚úÖ **Missing Data Simulation**
- MCAR vs. MAR mechanisms  
- Bias evaluation through simulations  

‚úÖ **Resampling Techniques**
- Bootstrap estimation of variance, bias, and medians  
- Jackknife variance and bias estimation  

‚úÖ **Bootstrap Regression**
- Random-X and Fixed-X bootstrapping of regression models  
- Confidence interval estimation via resampling
